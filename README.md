# CipherNet
### Objective
#### To embed a message into an image by manipulating some pixels such that the cipher is an image used to encrypt and decrypt the message.
### Tools
#### NumPy, Tensorflow-Keras, Matplotlib, Pillow and Resize-Image
### Procedure
1) Designing and training a neural network comprising of encoder and decoder
2) Encoder converts message into tokenized text and embeds it into an image.
3) Decoder takes the encoded image and deciphers the tokenized text.
4) Training is done using randomly generated images and texts so that the network can function with any type of images.
